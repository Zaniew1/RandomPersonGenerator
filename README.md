# RandomPersonGenerator
This app serves as a random person generator.
It shows basic info about random person: name, surname, picture, adress, and contact. 
This application use RandomPeople Api. 
In script I used fetch() and parsed json into object.
It was my first time with asynchronous JavaScript.
In styling I used glassmorphism.
